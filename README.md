# Property Watch

Property Watch is a web application that allows users to create their own watchlist to see when specific properties hit the market (currently Zillow). This saves countless hours for investors checking to see when their list of high value properties eventually go up for sale. 

This application was built using Python, PostgreSQL, Jinja, Flask, HTML and CSS. 

## Installation
